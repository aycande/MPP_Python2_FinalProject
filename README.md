# MPP_Python2_FinalProject
This repository is to showcase my skills in Python through my final project for the class 'Data and Programming in Python 2' at Harris School of Public Policy, University of Chicago. I have chosen my topic for the final project as International Climate Finance and looked up to the trends in historical cumulative carbon emissions of the states.
